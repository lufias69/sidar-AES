Dear Editor-in-Chief,

We submit for consideration the manuscript titled "Reliability and 
Validity of ChatGPT and Gemini for Essay Scoring: Evidence from 
Indonesian Higher Education" for publication in the Australasian 
Journal of Educational Technology.

This study makes three contributions relevant to AJET readership:

1. METHODOLOGICAL: First comprehensive reliability analysis (10 trials, 
   ICC >0.83) for LLM-based assessment, addressing fairness concerns 
   critical for high-stakes educational contexts.

2. REGIONAL: Demonstrates LLM-AES effectiveness in Indonesian language, 
   extending predominantly English-focused literature and highlighting 
   implications for linguistically diverse Asia-Pacific region.

3. PRACTICAL: Provides actionable deployment guidelines with cost-benefit 
   analysis (97% savings), directly relevant for resource-constrained 
   universities across the region.

Our findings demonstrate that AI-based essay grading can achieve 
validity (r=0.89) and reliability (ICC 0.95) suitable for practical 
deployment, with particular relevance for educators in Australia, 
New Zealand, and Southeast Asia seeking to scale personalized feedback 
while managing workload.

All authors approve this submission. There are no conflicts of interest. 
Data and code are available at [URL].

We suggest the following reviewers: [list]

Sincerely,
[Your name]
