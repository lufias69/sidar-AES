# Implications for Practice and Author Information

## Implications for practice or policy:

- **Higher education instructors** can adopt Gemini 2.0 Flash with lenient prompting to achieve 89% scoring accuracy while reducing assessment workload by 97% compared to ChatGPT-4o.
- **Curriculum designers** should integrate AI-assisted grading for formative assessment in large undergraduate classes, maintaining human oversight for high-stakes summative evaluations.
- **Educational administrators** can implement cost-effective automated essay scoring systems in resource-constrained Indonesian universities using Gemini at $0.03 per 100 essays.
- **Assessment policy makers** need to establish quality assurance protocols requiring minimum ICC >0.80 and critical error rates <5% before deploying LLM-based grading at institutional scale.
