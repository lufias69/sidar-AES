## Rubric Structure

### Dimensions and Weights

| Dimension | Indonesian Name | Weight | Description |
|-----------|----------------|--------|-------------|
| **Content Understanding** | Pemahaman Konten | 40% | Depth and accuracy of content understanding |
| **Organization & Structure** | Organisasi & Struktur | 30% | Essay structure, coherence, logical flow |
| **Arguments & Evidence** | Argumen & Bukti | 20% | Quality of arguments, use of evidence and examples |
| **Language & Mechanics** | Gaya Bahasa & Mekanik | 10% | Language quality, grammar, spelling, writing style |

### Score Calculation

**Composite Score Formula**:
$$
\text{Total Score} = (C \times 0.40) + (O \times 0.30) + (A \times 0.20) + (L \times 0.10) \times 0.8
$$

Where:
- $C$ = Content Understanding score (0-4)
- $O$ = Organization & Structure score (0-4)
- $A$ = Arguments & Evidence score (0-4)
- $L$ = Language & Mechanics score (0-4)

**Grade Conversion**:

| Letter Grade | Score Range | Percentage |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| **A** | 3.50 - 4.00 | 87.5% - 100% |
| **B** | 2.50 - 3.49 | 62.5% - 87.4% |
| **C** | 1.50 - 2.49 | 37.5% - 62.4% |
| **D** | 0.00 - 1.49 | 0% - 37.4% |

## Scoring Examples

### Example 1: High-Quality Essay (Grade A)

**Task**: "Reflect on your capstone project experience and its connection to course learning outcomes."

**Response Summary**: Student provides detailed reflection on specific project components, connects experiences to 3 learning outcomes with concrete examples, analyzes challenges faced and solutions implemented, demonstrates deep understanding of pedagogical principles, well-organized with clear introduction and conclusion, sophisticated academic language with no errors.

**Scores**:
- Content Understanding: **4** (demonstrates mastery, insightful connections)
- Organization & Structure: **4** (clear structure, smooth transitions)
- Arguments & Evidence: **4** (specific examples, deep analysis)
- Language & Mechanics: **4** (polished, error-free)

**Calculation**:
$$
(4 \times 0.40) + (4 \times 0.30) + (4 \times 0.20) + (4 \times 0.10) \times 0.8 = 3.20
$$

**Final Grade**: **A** (3.20/4.00)

---

### Example 2: Average Essay (Grade C)

**Task**: Same as above

**Response Summary**: Student mentions capstone project but with limited detail, makes some connections to learning outcomes but superficially, provides few specific examples, organization is unclear with weak transitions, several grammar errors and informal language, basic understanding shown but lacks depth.

**Scores**:
- Content Understanding: **2** (basic understanding, incomplete)
- Organization & Structure: **2** (weak structure, poor transitions)
- Arguments & Evidence: **2** (minimal examples, superficial)
- Language & Mechanics: **3** (clear despite errors)

**Calculation**:
$$
(2 \times 0.40) + (2 \times 0.30) + (2 \times 0.20) + (3 \times 0.10) \times 0.8 = 1.84
$$

**Final Grade**: **C** (1.84/4.00)

## Inter-Rater Reliability

To ensure consistent application of this rubric:

1. **Calibration**: All graders (human experts and AI) were calibrated using 5 sample essays
2. **Double-Grading**: 20% of essays were double-graded for reliability checks
3. **Agreement Metrics**:
   - Exact match: 65-87% (depending on condition)
   - Adjacent match (±1 grade): 94-100%
   - Fleiss' Kappa: 0.35-0.84 (fair to excellent)
   - ICC: 0.83-0.97 (good to excellent)

## Rubric Application Notes

### For Human Graders

1. **Read holistically first**: Get overall impression before scoring dimensions
2. **Use indicators as guides**: Not checklists - professional judgment required
3. **Consider context**: Adjust expectations based on assignment difficulty
4. **Document justifications**: Write brief notes for each dimension score
5. **Avoid halo effect**: Score each dimension independently

### For AI Implementation

1. **Rubric in prompt**: Full rubric specifications embedded in system message
2. **JSON output**: Structured format for dimension scores and justifications
3. **Temperature**: 0.3 (balance creativity and consistency)
4. **Examples**: Few-shot prompting with 3 graded examples improves reliability
5. **Justification**: AI must provide reasoning for each dimension score

---

## Limitations

1. **Subjectivity**: Some dimensions (e.g., Content) more subjective than others (e.g., Language)
2. **Context-Dependent**: Rubric designed for capstone reflections, may need adaptation for other essay types
3. **Language**: Indonesian context - some criteria may not translate directly to other languages
4. **Binary Boundaries**: Letter grade cutoffs are somewhat arbitrary (e.g., 3.49 vs 3.50)

---

## Recommended Uses

✅ **Appropriate for**:
- Capstone project reflections
- Essay-type open-ended questions
- Formative and summative assessment
- AI-assisted grading research

❌ **Not appropriate for**:
- Multiple-choice questions
- Short-answer factual questions
- Creative writing (needs different rubric)
- Mathematical proofs (needs specialized rubric)
