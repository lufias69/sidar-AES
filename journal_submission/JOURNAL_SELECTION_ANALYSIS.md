**Novelty Statement**:
"This work makes three novel contributions: (1) first multi-trial reliability analysis for LLM-AES (ICC >0.83, Fleiss' κ >0.79), (2) first comparative study of ChatGPT vs. Gemini for educational assessment, and (3) first demonstration of LLM-AES effectiveness in Indonesian language contexts."

**Impact Statement**:
"Our findings demonstrate that AI-based essay grading can achieve validity (r=0.89) and reliability (ICC=0.949) suitable for practical deployment in higher education, with cost reductions up to 97% compared to human grading. The actionable deployment guidelines and open dataset advance both research and practice in technology-enhanced assessment."
