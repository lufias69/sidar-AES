# Manuscript Blinding Guide & Checklist

**Purpose:** Remove ALL author-identifying information from manuscript before submission  
**Critical:** Assessing Writing uses double-blind peer review - reviewers must NOT know author identities

---

## Why Blinding Matters

❌ **Reject Risk:** Manuscripts with author identifiers may be desk-rejected  
✅ **Fair Review:** Blinding ensures reviewers evaluate work on merit, not author reputation  
🔍 **What Editors Check:** First thing editors look for before sending to reviewers

---

## Two Versions Required

### Version 1: **title_page.docx** 
- ✅ **WITH** all author information
- ✅ Author names, affiliations, emails, ORCID
- ✅ Acknowledgments with names
- 📤 Upload as "Title Page" file

### Version 2: **manuscript_blinded.docx**
- ❌ **NO** author-identifying information
- ❌ No names, affiliations, institutions
- ❌ No "our previous work" citations
- 📤 Upload as "Manuscript" file

---

## Complete Blinding Checklist

### ✅ HEADER & FOOTER

- [ ] Remove author names from header
- [ ] Remove institution from header
- [ ] Remove author names from footer
- [ ] Keep only page numbers (bottom center)
- [ ] Remove any "confidential" or draft stamps with names

**How to check:** View → Header and Footer → Delete all text except page numbers

---

### ✅ TITLE PAGE (Remove Entire Section)

**DELETE from manuscript_blinded.docx:**
- [ ] Author names and degrees
- [ ] Author affiliations and addresses
- [ ] Email addresses
- [ ] Phone numbers
- [ ] ORCID iDs
- [ ] Corresponding author section
- [ ] Author contribution statements
- [ ] Funding acknowledgments (if mention author names)

**Keep in title_page.docx only**

---

### ✅ ABSTRACT & KEYWORDS

- [ ] Check abstract has no "we" or "our team"
- [ ] No institution names
- [ ] No grant numbers that identify institution
- [ ] Keywords do not include author names or institutions

**Replace:** "We conducted..." → "This study conducted..."  
**Replace:** "Our findings..." → "The findings..." or "Results indicate..."

---

### ✅ INTRODUCTION

- [ ] No "we" statements identifying authors
- [ ] No "our research group" references
- [ ] No mentions like "at our institution"
- [ ] No "in our country/region" that's too specific

**OK:** "This study examines..."  
**NOT OK:** "We at [Institution] developed..."

---

### ✅ LITERATURE REVIEW

- [ ] Self-citations changed to third person
- [ ] No "our previous work" or "we previously showed"
- [ ] No obvious self-citation patterns (e.g., 5 citations to same first author)

**Example:**
- ❌ **Before:** "We previously demonstrated (Author et al., 2023) that..."
- ✅ **After:** "Previous research demonstrated (Author, 2023) that..."
- ✅ **Alternative:** "Smith et al. (2023) showed that..."

**For self-citations:**
- Cite normally but don't highlight as "our work"
- Mix with other citations
- Can include if necessary but don't emphasize

---

### ✅ METHOD SECTION

- [ ] No institution name where study conducted
- [ ] No IRB protocol numbers (can mention approved but not specific number)
- [ ] No course codes/names that identify institution
- [ ] No instructor names
- [ ] No unique program names

**Example:**
- ❌ **Before:** "Conducted at [University Name], approved by IRB #2023-456"
- ✅ **After:** "Conducted at a public university in Indonesia, approved by institutional ethics committee"

- ❌ **Before:** "Students in ENGL-401: Advanced Academic Writing taught by Professor Smith"
- ✅ **After:** "Students in a capstone project course for undergraduate education majors"

---

### ✅ PARTICIPANTS

- [ ] No specific institution names
- [ ] No unique program descriptors
- [ ] Demographic information general enough to not identify

**OK:** "10 students from a public university in Indonesia"  
**NOT OK:** "10 students from [Specific University Name], one of only three universities in [specific city] offering this program"

---

### ✅ DATA COLLECTION

- [ ] No specific dates that could identify (OK: "Fall 2024", NOT OK: "October 15-November 20, 2024 at [University]")
- [ ] No unique project/grant names
- [ ] No software with institution licenses that identify

---

### ✅ RESULTS

Usually safe, but check:
- [ ] No table/figure captions mentioning institutions
- [ ] No footnotes with institutional details
- [ ] No comparisons like "at our institution compared to national average"

---

### ✅ DISCUSSION

- [ ] No "at our institution"
- [ ] No "in our context" if too specific
- [ ] No "our findings compared to our previous work"
- [ ] Self-citations in third person

---

### ✅ ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

**Two options:**

**Option A: Remove Entirely from Blinded Manuscript**
- [ ] Delete entire Acknowledgments section
- Keep full version in title_page.docx
- Most common approach

**Option B: Blind the Acknowledgments**
- [ ] Remove all names (colleagues, students, RAs)
- [ ] Remove specific grant numbers
- [ ] Remove institutional funding sources
- Can keep generic: "The authors thank anonymous reviewers for feedback"

**Recommendation:** Remove entirely, easier to avoid mistakes

---

### ✅ REFERENCES

- [ ] Self-citations are OK but don't highlight as yours
- [ ] Mix self-citations among others
- [ ] No "Author (in press)" where you're the author
- [ ] No URLs to your institutional repository
- [ ] No "Author et al. (unpublished manuscript)" if you're author

**If you have many self-citations:**
- They're acceptable if relevant
- Don't bunch together (spread through reference list)
- Cite normally without special mention

---

### ✅ FIGURES & TABLES

- [ ] No author names in figure files metadata
- [ ] No institution logos/watermarks
- [ ] No captions mentioning "our data from [institution]"
- [ ] No acknowledgment in figure notes

**File names:**
- ✅ **OK:** "figure1_confusion_matrix.png"
- ❌ **NOT OK:** "AuthorName_2024_figure1.png"

---

### ✅ SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS

- [ ] Check all supplementary files for author info
- [ ] No author names in file metadata
- [ ] No author names in code comments
- [ ] No institutional paths (e.g., /Users/YourName/Research/)
- [ ] No personal GitHub links in code

**For code/data:**
- Use generic paths
- Remove personal comments
- No author names in file headers
- Can mention "available upon acceptance"

---

### ✅ FOOTNOTES & ENDNOTES

- [ ] No footnotes with author names or institutions
- [ ] No grant acknowledgments with identifying info
- [ ] No conference presentation details (e.g., "presented by AuthorName at Conference")

---

### ✅ METADATA (File Properties)

**CRITICAL - Often forgotten!**

**In Microsoft Word:**
1. File → Info → Properties → Advanced Properties
2. Check these tabs:
   - [ ] **Summary:** Remove author name, company, keywords with names
   - [ ] **Statistics:** Usually OK (automatic)
   - [ ] **Custom:** Remove any custom properties with identifying info

**Or:** File → Info → Inspect Document → Remove All (author, comments, hidden text)

**In PDF (if converting):**
- File → Properties → Description
- Remove author, subject, keywords fields

---

### ✅ TRACKED CHANGES & COMMENTS

- [ ] Accept all tracked changes
- [ ] Delete all comments (may contain author names)
- [ ] Remove highlighting with author names in notes
- [ ] Check for hidden text

**How to remove in Word:**
- Review → Accept All Changes
- Review → Delete All Comments
- Review → Show Markup → [Uncheck all]

---

## Automated Blinding Check

### Use Word's Find Feature

**Search for these patterns (Ctrl+F):**

1. **Your name(s):**
   - Search: "[YourLastName]"
   - Should only appear in references (if self-citations)

2. **Institution name:**
   - Search: "[YourUniversity]"
   - Should be 0 results

3. **"We" statements:**
   - Search: "we "
   - Review each, replace with third person if identifying

4. **"Our" statements:**
   - Search: "our "
   - Replace "our findings" → "the findings"
   - Replace "our study" → "this study"
   - OK to keep: "our results", "our data" (referring to the study itself)

5. **Pronouns:**
   - Search: "our team"
   - Search: "our group"
   - Search: "our institution"
   - Should be 0 results

6. **Email addresses:**
   - Search: "@"
   - Should be 0 results (except in URLs/references)

## Compare Versions Checklist

**After creating both versions:**

| Element | title_page.docx | manuscript_blinded.docx |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Author names | ✅ Present | ❌ Removed |
| Affiliations | ✅ Present | ❌ Removed |
| Acknowledgments | ✅ Full version | ❌ Removed or generic |
| "We" statements | ✅ OK | ⚠️ Minimized/third person |
| Institution name | ✅ Present | ❌ Removed |
| Funding (with names) | ✅ Full details | ❌ Generic or removed |
| File properties (author) | ✅ Your name | ❌ Blank or generic |

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ MISTAKE 1: Leaving "We" Everywhere
**Problem:** Overuse of "we" makes it clear authors are describing own work  
**Solution:** Use third person or passive voice in blinded version

### ❌ MISTAKE 2: Obvious Self-Citation Pattern
**Problem:** 8 out of 10 intro citations are "Smith et al." where Smith is author  
**Solution:** Include more diverse citations, don't bunch self-citations

### ❌ MISTAKE 3: Too-Specific Context
**Problem:** "One of only two programs in Southeast Asia offering..."  
**Solution:** Be more general - "A program in Southeast Asia"

### ❌ MISTAKE 4: File Metadata
**Problem:** File properties show "Author: John Smith, Company: XYZ University"  
**Solution:** File → Info → Remove All Personal Information

### ❌ MISTAKE 5: Acknowledgments in Blinded Version
**Problem:** "We thank Dr. Jane Doe from our department..."  
**Solution:** Remove entire Acknowledgments section from blinded version

---

## Final Verification Steps

### Before Uploading Blinded Manuscript:

1. **[ ] Open manuscript_blinded.docx**
2. **[ ] Do Ctrl+F search for your name** → Should be 0 (except possibly in references)
3. **[ ] Do Ctrl+F search for institution** → Should be 0
4. **[ ] Check File → Info → Properties** → Author should be blank or "Anonymous"
5. **[ ] Review → Check for Comments/Tracked Changes** → Remove all
6. **[ ] Read abstract and intro** → Does it read like someone else wrote it?
7. **[ ] Check header/footer** → Only page numbers, no names
8. **[ ] Save As new file** → Don't overwrite original

### Side-by-Side Check:
- Open title_page.docx and manuscript_blinded.docx
- Compare page 1: Title page should have names, blinded should not
- Compare Acknowledgments: Full version in title page, absent in blinded
- Compare file sizes: Should be similar (if very different, something's wrong)

---

## Example Transformations

### Abstract
**Before (with author info):**
> "We conducted a comprehensive study at XYZ University with 10 students..."

**After (blinded):**
> "This study presents a comprehensive evaluation with 10 students from a public university in Indonesia..."

---

### Introduction
**Before:**
> "Our research group previously demonstrated (Smith et al., 2023) that..."

**After:**
> "Previous research has demonstrated (Smith et al., 2023) that..."

---

### Method
**Before:**
> "This study was conducted in the Educational Technology program at ABC University (IRB #2024-123) during Fall 2024 semester."

**After:**
> "This study was conducted in an educational technology program at a public university in Indonesia, approved by the institutional ethics committee, during the 2024 academic year."

---

### Acknowledgments
**Before (in non-blinded version):**
> "We thank Dr. Jane Smith for assistance with data collection, the ABC University Writing Center for support, and Research Grant #12345 from the National Science Foundation."

**After (blinded version):**
> [Remove entire section]

---

## Quick Reference: Replace These

| Remove/Replace | With |
|----------------|------|
| "We conducted" | "This study conducted" |
| "Our findings" | "The findings" / "Results" |
| "Our previous work" | "Previous research" |
| "[University Name]" | "A public university in Indonesia" |
| "IRB #2024-123" | "Institutional ethics committee approval" |
| "Professor Jane Smith" | "Course instructor" |
| "Our department" | "The department" / [remove] |
| "At our institution" | "In this context" / [remove] |
| "We developed" | "The researchers developed" / "A protocol was developed" |

## After Blinding: Test Read

**Ask yourself:**
- [ ] Could I identify the authors from this manuscript?
- [ ] Does it read objectively (not "our team's groundbreaking work")?
- [ ] Are institutional details generic enough?
- [ ] Would a colleague recognize this as our work?

**If YES to any above:** Blind more thoroughly

---

## Upload Checklist

**Before hitting Submit:**

- [ ] title_page.docx has ALL author information
- [ ] manuscript_blinded.docx has NO author information
- [ ] Both files are .docx format (not .doc)
- [ ] File names are generic (not "AuthorName_Manuscript.docx")
- [ ] Supplementary files also blinded (no author info)
- [ ] File properties cleaned (author = blank)
- [ ] PDF preview shows no author info in blinded version

---

## Emergency Unblinding

**If manuscript accepted:**
- Editor will combine title_page.docx info with manuscript_blinded.docx
- You may be asked to provide "final version" with full author info
- Production team will handle proper formatting for publication

**Don't worry:** Blinding is only for peer review stage

---

**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes to thoroughly blind manuscript  
**Priority:** HIGH - Required before submission  
**Risk if Done Wrong:** Desk rejection without review
